    "# Training DeepSD models\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook trains DeepSD models with training data prepared using\n",
    "`deepsd_data_prep.ipynb`. Here, it is assumed that available data is present on\n",
    "azure storage and separated by year and month. The model architecture and\n",
    "training parameters are taken from\n",
    "[this KDD paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.03126), and the model training code\n",
    "is adapted from the [deepsd github repo](https://github.com/tjvandal/deepsd). We\n",
    "[forked the SRCNN repo implemented by the DeepSD author](https://github.com/carbonplan/srcnn-tensorflow)\n",
    "and made slight modifications described in this\n",
    "[PR](https://github.com/carbonplan/srcnn-tensorflow/pull/1).\n",
    "\n",
    "Main differences between the DeepSD model described in the paper and implemented\n",
    "in this notebook are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The batch normalization layer originally in the SCRNN model was removed.\n",
    "   Instead, the input data is normalized by a 30 year historical average and\n",
    "   standard deviation in the data prep notebook. This historical average and\n",
    "   standard deviation is then used to restored downscaled GCM data as a form of\n",
    "   bias correction. Note that alternatively, we can first bias correct the GCM\n",
    "   data to the historical observation data, then normalize/restore GCM data\n",
    "   using the historical average of the GCM data. This is not implemented for the\n",
    "   sake of time commitment.\n",
    "2. The paper described training the model with 10^7 iterations. In this\n",
    "   notebook, the precip model was trained with 3000 iterations and tmax/tmin\n",
    "   models were trained with 1000 iterations. The reduced number of iterations\n",
    "   used was mainly due to time saving, as model training was done with CPU only\n",
    "   at this point. The difference iterations in precip and termpature model was\n",
    "   due to the observation that, the training loss and RMSE quickly go towards 0\n",
    "   after training started for temperature models. My hypothesis is that this is\n",
    "   due to the data normalization routine. Since there are pronounced seasonal\n",
    "   trends in temperature and we use the simple 30 year historical average at\n",
    "   each pixel for normalization, the \"normalized\" temperature data may be mostly\n",
    "   exhibiting the seasonal trends. Thus, the data may seem \"easy\" to predict by\n",
    "   the model based on the coarse scale data. To confirm this hypothesis, trend\n",
    "   removal techniques (e.g. removal of long term moving average) can be\n",
    "   implemented to make sure that the model is learning to predict the\n",
    "   \"anomalies\" instead of the trends. A complementary hypothesis is that the\n",
    "   fine scale elevation data used as auxilliary data is very informative in\n",
    "   disaggregating temperature data (since there is well known relationship\n",
    "   between elevation and temperature). If this is the case, the model may be\n",
    "   naturally doing well and we can trust the low error metrics.\n",
    "\n",
    "DeepSD models are stacked models of SRCNN. As an example, a DeepSD model that\n",
    "downscaled data from 2 degree to 0.25 degree (an 8-fold increase in resolution)\n",
    "would be a stacked model of 3 SRCNN models, each with a 2-fold increase in\n",
    "resolution (2^3 = 8). During training, each of the SRCNN model is trained\n",
    "independently. Then, as the last step we stack the trained models together to\n",
    "form the joint models. Two joint models are compiled for each variable in this\n",
    "notebook, one downscaling from 2 degree to 0.25 degree, and the other\n",
    "downscaling from 1 degree to 0.25 degree. These two models will then be used\n",
    "according to the initial resolution of the GCM model in question. If the\n",
    "original GCM model has a resolution coarser than or close to 2 degree, the GCM\n",
    "data will first be interpolated to 2 degree and then downscaled. If the original\n",
    "GCM model has a resolution closer to 1 degree, then the GCM data will first be\n",
    "interpolated to 1 degree and downscaled. The starting resolution of each GCM\n",
    "model is calculated in `deepsd_data_prep.ipynb` and manually copied to\n",
    "`deepsd.py` file for usage during inference.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook saved the model files locally then put them on azure cloud. The\n",
    "file names used are then copied to `deepsd.py` manually to be read during\n",
    "inference.\n"
